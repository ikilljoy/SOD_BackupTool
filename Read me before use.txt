The original exe must be kept inside the main folder with the 2 bat files. (backup & restore)
if you'd like to move it for ease of acess you can create a shortcut to place anywhere.

this file is 100% open source Freeware - no nags, no ads and fully functional.
The menu is simply a basic vbs project that opens the bat files which copies a backup of your game save.
It will create a folder named SODbackups in your documents folder to store your backups,
Backing up will overwrite the previous backup you have saved in this location.

This has been tested and ran flawlessly by myself and 2 others on 5/24/18
but BE WARNED the buttons will overwrite/replace your current game save and cannot be undone
so make sure you use them in the correct order (Backup before restore)
If you restore without a backup it may erase your game save.
If you have any questions feel free to msg me on twitter (Twitter button in app)
