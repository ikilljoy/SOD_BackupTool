--THIS PROGRAM WILL ONLY FUNCTION IF RAN WITH ADMIN RIGHTS---<br>
(Unless you execute via batch/No GUI)<br>
<br>
The original exe must be kept inside the main folder with the 2 bat files. (backup & restore)<br>
if you'd like to move it for ease of acess you can create a shortcut to place anywhere.<br>
<br>
this file is 100% open source Freeware - no nags, no ads and fully functional.<br>
The menu is simply a basic vbs project that opens the bat files which copies a backup of your game save.<br>
It will create a folder named SODbackups in your documents folder to store your backups,<br>
Backing up will overwrite the previous backup you have saved in this location.<br>
<br>
This has been tested and ran flawlessly by myself and 2 others on 5/24/18<br>
but BE WARNED the buttons will overwrite/replace your current game save and cannot be undone<br>
so make sure you use them in the correct order (Backup before restore)<br>
If you restore without a backup it may erase your game save.<br>
If you have any questions feel free to msg me on twitter (Twitter button in app)<br>
